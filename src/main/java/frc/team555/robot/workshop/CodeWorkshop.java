     * Welcome to the Robot Petting Zoo!
     *
     * We're Team 555. We compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition (da big boi robots) and for today only, you
     * can get a taste of what is like to program a --
     *
     * Wait. WAIT! Please don't leave! Coding can be fun, we promise. Let us introduce you to our friend.
     *
     * Meet "robot". robot is a robot who really, REALLY likes grammar -- no, not English. He speaks a language
     * called Java, and once you learn it, you can tell robot to do all sorts of things.
     *
     * To give robot something to do, just write a sentence in Java:
     *  - His name, (sup "robot"?)
     *  - A period, "."
     *  - And robot will tell you about all the MAGICAL things he can do!
     *
     * In the end, your code might look something like this:
     *
     *    robot.forward();
     *    robot.left();
     *    robot.right(2);
     *
     * robot will go forward, turn left, then turn right 2 times (ooh, aah).
     *
     * Welp, that's about it. Please sign up for the Montclair Robotics Club this fall, see if you like it.
     *
     *
     * Peace, love, and Java,
     * The Code Division
